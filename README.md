### About me
I am a DeFi and NFT marketplace developer.

I have been researching and developing DeFi projects for 2 years and have very rich experience in this field.<br/>
I experienced Uniswap, SushiSwap and Pancakeswap booms, and I have been studying DeFi projects and learned the forking methods from Uniswap.
I am currently all-in on Pancakeswap Forking projects.<br/>
I have already performed a number of Pancakeswap Forking projects on Fiverr and has launched a number of DeFi sites.

Please check my Fiverr Gig.<br/>

Currently, I have the technology to launch a DeFi site within 2 days once an order is placed.
I am hoping to connect with more customers in the future and join them in innovative projects. 

Please let me know if you need my skills and experience anytime.
Thank you.
